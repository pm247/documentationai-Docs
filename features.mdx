## Structuring Documentation Spaces and Folders

Create dedicated spaces for different projects or teams, then use folders to group related documents. This keeps your documentation scalable and easy to navigate.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Space" icon="plus">
    Navigate to the dashboard and select `New Space`. Enter a name like "API Docs" and set permissions for team members.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Folders" icon="folder-plus">
    Inside the space, click `New Folder`. Name it "Endpoints" or "Guides" and drag documents into place.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nest Folders" icon="layers">
    Right-click a folder to create subfolders. Use this for deep hierarchies like "v1.0/Authentication".
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use spaces for high-level separation (e.g., public vs. internal docs) and folders for granular organization.
</Callout>

## Adding and Formatting Content with Rich Text Editors

MyCMO's editor supports rich text, Markdown, and embeds. Format headings, lists, tables, and more without coding.

```
````
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Embeds" icon="link">
    Paste URLs for automatic embeds from GitHub, YouTube, or Figma.

    Example: Paste `https://github.com/MyCMO-com-au` to embed the repo overview.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Version Control and Change Tracking

Every edit creates a version snapshot. You review diffs, restore previous versions, or compare changes across time.

<Expandable title="How Versioning Works" default-open="true">
  MyCMO automatically saves versions on each publish. Access history via the document menu.

  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      A[Draft Edit] --> B[Publish]
      B --> C[Version 1.0]
      C --> D[Next Edit]
      D --> E[Version 1.1]
      E --> F[Compare/Revert]
  ```
</Expandable>

<CodeGroup tabs="CLI,API">
````bash
# Via CLI tool
mycmo version list --doc-id=123
mycmo version revert --doc-id=123 --version=1.0
````

````javascript
// API call
const versions = await fetch('https://api.example.com/docs/123/versions');
const data = await versions.json();
console.log(data);
````
</CodeGroup>

## Search and Filtering Tools for Documents

Quickly locate documents with full-text search, tags, and filters. Search across spaces, folders, and content.

| Feature | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Full-Text Search | Matches keywords in titles and body | Find "authentication" across all docs |
| Tag Filters | Apply tags like `api`, `internal` | Filter by topic or status |
| Advanced Filters | Date range, author, space | Recent changes by team lead |
| Saved Searches | Bookmark frequent queries | Weekly security review |

<Callout kind="info">
  Pro tip: Combine tags with search for precise results, like `token +api`.
</Callout>

These features form the foundation of MyCMO. Start by setting up a space and experiment with the editor to see immediate benefits in your workflow.
